Stuff I made to make working with Datadog easier  
Some scripts might require a `settings.json` file, which is a simple JSON-formatted file with Datadog API and APP keys.  

- [api.py][api]: Authenticate to the DD API and drop into an interactive shell  
- [getScreen.py][getScreen]: Get the JSON for a screenboard and save it to a local file    
- [putScreen.py][putScreen]: Upload the JSON for a screenboard to DD  
- [settings.json.example][settings.json]: Account API/APP keys for DD-related things  

[api]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/api.py
[getScreen]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/getScreen.py
[putScreen]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/putScreen.py
[settings.json]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/settings.json.example

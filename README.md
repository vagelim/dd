Stuff I made to make working with Datadog easier
Some scripts might require a `settings.json` file, which is a simple JSON-formatted file with Datadog API and APP keys.  

- [api.py][api]: Authenticate to the DD API and drop into an interactive shell  
- [settings.json.example][settings.json]  

[api]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/api.py
[settings.json]: https://github.com/vagelim/dd/blob/master/settings.json.example

# ddBackup â€” prevent accidental timeboard/screenboard modifications
Ever delete a dashboard accidentally? Or change one and wish you hadn't? We all do. This tool is to help get out of a sticky situation.

## Setup
In a shell:  
`pip install datadog`

`export DD_APP=<your APP key>`  
(optionally, add the exports to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`)
